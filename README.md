# app-borgmatic

This repository helps setting up and restoring backups using [borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/).

## Getting started

Clone this repository on the server that needs to be backed up:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/redpencilio/app-borgmatic.git
```

Ensure [mu-cli](https://github.com/mu-semtech/mu-cli/) is available on the machine.

Navigate to the cloned repository:

``` bash
cd app-borgmatic
```

## How-to guides
### How to setup backups for a semantic.works application
#### Setup SSH key pair to connect to the remote storage box (only once)
Generate an SSH key pair using mu-cli. The key will be authorized on the remote storage box. Therefore you will need to enter the user's password of the storage box interactively.

``` bash
mu script project-scripts ssh-key add <user>@<host>:<port>
```

Next, move the generated SSH key pair to the server's `.ssh/` directory:

``` bash
rm -r ~/.ssh/id_borgmatic/ ; mv id_borgmatic{,.pub} ~/.ssh/
```

Borgmatic is now authorized to execute `borg` commands on the remote storage box using the generated SSH key pair `~/.ssh/id_borgmatic`.

This step needs to be executed only once during the initial setup of the backups. It doesn't need to be repeated in the future when new applications are added to the backup config.

When using Hetzner storage boxes for backup, ensure to enable SSH access (which includes Borg support) on the storage box.

#### Generate Borgmatic config to backup a semantic.works application (once per application)
Generate a Borgmatic configuration for the application that needs to be backed up using mu-cli.

``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-backup-config app <user>@<host>:<port> <hostname> <app-name>
```

E.g.
``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-backup-config app u1234-sub1@u1234.your-storagebox.de:23 abb-croco app-mandatendatabank
```

The script will generate a new config in `./config/borgmatic.d/<app-name>.yml` and update `docker-compose.override.yml` accordingly.

Open the config file and make sure `source_directories` contain the folders that need to be backed up.

Next, (re)up the Borgmatic stack:

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

Initialize the backup repository for the application:

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic borgmatic init --repository <app-name> --encryption repokey --append-only
```

Finally, export the repository key and store it somewhere save together with the passphrase and repository path generated by the `generate-backup-config` script. You will need those to be able to restore backups.

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic borgmatic key export --repository <app-name>
```

This step needs to be repeated for each application that requires a backup. For backups of app-http-logger, see [How to backup app-http-logger](#how-to-backup-app-http-logger).

### How to setup backups for app-http-logger
If not done yet, setup SSH access from the machine to the backup server following the guide 'Setup SSH key pair to connect to the remote storage box (only once)' in [How to setup backups for a semantic.works application](#how-to-setup-backups-for-a-semanticworks-application).

Next, generate a config to backup HTTP logs generated by app-http-logger using mu-cli:

``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-backup-config http-log <user>@<host>:<port> <hostname> <app-name>
```

E.g.
``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-backup-config http-log u1234-sub1@u1234.your-storagebox.de:23 abb-croco app-http-logger
```

The script will generate a new config in `./config/borgmatic.d/<app-name>.yml` and update `docker-compose.override.yml` accordingly.

Next, (re)up the Borgmatic stack:

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

Initialize the backup repository for the application:

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic borgmatic init --repository app-http-logger --encryption repokey --append-only
```

Finally, export the repository key and store it somewhere save together with the passphrase and repository path generated by the `generate-backup-config` script. You will need those to be able to restore backups.

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic borgmatic key export --repository app-http-logger
```

### How to change the backup frequency
Change the backup frequency by updating the `BACKUP_CRON` environment variable on the `borgmatic` service in `docker-compose.yml`.

This pattern applies on all repositories configured in `./config/borgmatic.d`. It's currently not possible to configure a different pattern per backup repository.

Next, up the stack again:

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

### How to access backups from your local machine
This how-to guide assumes `docker-compose.dev.yml` is automatically taken into account on your local machine.

First, we need to make sure we can access the remote backup server from our local machine. If you already have an SSH key with access to the storage box, put the key pair in `./ssh-keys/id_borgmatic{,.pub}`. Otherwise, we will generate an SSH key and grant ourselves (temporary) access. Therefore, you will need to enter the password of the storage box interactively.
``` bash
mu script project-scripts ssh-key add <user>@<host>:<port>
```

When using Hetzner storage boxes, make sure to enable 'External reachability' on the (sub)account such that we cannot reach the storage box from a machine that is not in the Hetzner network.

Next, we will generate a minimalistic Borgmatic configuration to access the remote backup repository.

``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-restore-config <repository_path> <passphrase>
```

E.g. 

``` bash
mu script project-scripts generate-restore-config ssh://u1234-sub1@u1234.your-storagebox.de:23/./abb-croco-app-mandatendatabank.borg my-secret-passphrase
```

Next, start the application stack.

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should now be able to access the backup repository on the remote server via the `borgmatic-restore` service.

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic-restore borgmatic list
```

In order to restore files, `exec` in the `borgmatic-restore` service:

``` bash
docker compose exec borgmatic-restore bash
```

Inside the container, mount a repository archive (e.g. `latest`):

``` bash
borgmatic mount --archive latest --mount-point /mnt
```

You can now inspect the files in `/mnt/`. Use the bind-mounted `/restore` folder in the container to copy files to `./data/restore` on the host machine.

E.g.
``` bash
cp /mnt/data/app-mandatendatabank/docker-compose.yml /restore
```

When done, unmount the archive and exit the container.

``` bash
umount /mnt && exit
```

Don't forget, when you're finished, to remove the SSH key access from the backup server again:

``` bash
mu script project-scripts ssh-key rm <user>@<host>:<port>
```

### How to include borgmatic metrics in a configured `node-exporter`
This how-to-guide assumes a metrics stack including a `node-exporter` service is running on your server (e.g. in `/data/metrics`). How to setup such a stack is explained in [app-server-monitor](https://github.com/redpencilio/app-server-monitor?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-add-a-server-to-be-monitored).

The app-borgmatic stack includes a `borgmatic-exporter` container to export metrics for Prometheus. The metrics are written to a text file in `./data/borgmatic-exporter/metrics/`, ready to be fed to a [node-exporter textfile collector](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter?tab=readme-ov-file#textfile-collector).

Open the `docker-compose.yml` of the metrics stack and update the `node-exporter` service with a new volume mount and matching command argument:

```yml
services:
  exporter:
    image: quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter
    ...
    volumes:
      - ...
      - /data/app-borgmatic/data/borgmatic-exporter/metrics:/data/borgmatic-metrics:ro
    command:
      - "--collector.textfile.directory=/data/borgmatic-metrics"
```

Next, restart the exporter service:

``` bash
docker compose up -d exporter
```

The Borgmatic metrics will now be collected my Prometheus and will be available for visualization in Grafana.

### How to run any borgmatic/borg command
Any `borgmatic` command (see [Borgmatic command-line reference](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/command-line/)) can be executed by using `exec` in the `borgmatic-restore` container.

```bash
docker compose exec borgmatic-restore borgmatic <any-borgmatic-command>
```

By default, the command will be executed on all repositories configured in `./config/borgmatic.d`. To specify a specific repository, use the `--repository` option.

E.g.
```bash
docker compose exec borgmatic-restore borgmatic list --repository app-mandatendatabank
```

Any `borg` command (see [borg usage guide](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/general.html)) can be executed through `borgmatic` by executing:
```bash
docker compose exec borgmatic-restore borgmatic borg <any-borg-command>
```

This has the advantage of using the borgmatic configuration, simplifying the underlying `borg` command.
